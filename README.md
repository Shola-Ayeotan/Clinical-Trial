# Clinical Trial 
This project sought to provide valuable insights into the world of clinical research by combining clinical trial data with information on pharmaceutical companies.

This analysis covered various aspects of clinical trials, including study types, common medical conditions, top sponsors, seasonal trends, compliance violations, and more. These insights are crucial for advancing evidence-based knowledge in drug development and patient treatments. 

To conduct the analysis, three distinct methodologies were used: **PySpark RDD, PySpark Dataframe,** and **Spark SQL**. Each approach offered unique perspectives and capabilities for dissecting and understanding the data.
